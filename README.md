  "description": "Hey there! My name's Braden Hammond. I'm an attendee of UCSD's Full Stack Development Program, graduating in late August of this year. Within my profile, you'll find a collection of assignments completed on behalf of my attendance at the university, as well as personal projects. While my introduction to software development was recent, I have several years of experience within the IT security sector. Being fortunate enough to work on behalf of corporations such as Avnet Incorporated at their Phoenix, Arizona corporate headquarters taught me the importance of InfoSec and SpecOps in the digital age, inspiring a career change into the ever-growing software development sphere.",
